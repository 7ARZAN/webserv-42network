Webserv

Webserv is a lightweight, high-performance HTTP/1.1 web server written in C++98. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, it supports GET, POST, and DELETE methods, CGI execution, file uploads, directory listing, and session management. Built with a focus on robustness and extensibility, Webserv is ideal for educational purposes, small-scale deployments, or as a foundation for custom web server projects.

Features

HTTP/1.1 Compliance: Supports GET, POST, and DELETE methods with proper status code handling.
CGI Support: Executes scripts in PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, and custom CGI programs.
File Uploads: Handles multipart/form-data for file uploads with configurable upload directories.
Directory Listing: Optional auto-indexing for directories without an index file.
Session Management: Secure session handling with server-side storage and cookie-based tracking.
Configuration: Flexible configuration via a custom .conf file for ports, root directories, and more.
Logging: Configurable logging levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG) with file and console output.
Non-blocking I/O: Efficient handling of multiple connections using poll.
C++98 Standard: Ensures compatibility with older compilers and environments.

Installation
Prerequisites

Compiler: A C++98-compliant compiler (e.g., g++).
Operating System: Linux or Unix-like system (tested on Ubuntu).
Dependencies: Standard C++ library, POSIX libraries (sys/socket.h, poll.h, etc.).

Building

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webserv.git
cd webserv


Compile the source code:
make

This will generate the webserv executable.

(Optional) Install dependencies for CGI scripts (e.g., PHP, Python):
sudo apt-get install php python3 perl ruby



Usage
Run the web server by providing a configuration file:
./webserv config/ws_configuration.conf

The server will listen on the ports specified in the configuration file and serve content from the configured root directory.
Example Requests

GET a file:
curl http://localhost:8080/index.html


POST a file:
curl -F "file=@localfile.txt" http://localhost:8080/upload


DELETE a resource:
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/file.txt



Configuration
Webserv uses a .conf file to configure server settings. Below is an example configuration:
[default]
log_path = logs/webserv.log
log_level = INFO
dirlist = true

[server1]
port = 8080
root_dir = www
upload_dir = www/uploads
max_connections = 100
req_timeout = 30
PHPCGI = /usr/bin/php
PYCGI = /usr/bin/python3

Configuration Options



Key
Description
Example Value



log_path
Path to the log file
logs/webserv.log


log_level
Logging level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
INFO


dirlist
Enable directory listing (true/false)
true


port
Port to listen on
8080


root_dir
Root directory for serving files
www


upload_dir
Directory for uploaded files
www/uploads


max_connections
Maximum simultaneous connections
100


req_timeout
Request timeout in seconds
30


PHPCGI
Path to PHP CGI executable
/usr/bin/php


PYCGI
Path to Python CGI executable
/usr/bin/python3


Place your configuration file in the config/ directory or specify a custom path when running the server.
Session Management
Webserv includes a robust session management system:

Session Creation: Each client receives a unique session ID stored in a session cookie.
Session Storage: Session data is stored server-side in an in-memory std::map.
Expiration: Sessions expire after 1 hour (configurable via code).
Usage Example:// In a CGI script or custom handler
std::string sessionId = response.createSession();
response.setSessionData(sessionId, "username", "tarzan");
std::string username = response.getSessionData(sessionId, "username");



To use sessions in CGI scripts, parse the session cookie and query the server for session data.
